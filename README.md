# GallardoCupHolder
Cupholder upgrade for Lamborghini Gallardo models equipped with the travel pack. This new design gives the cupholder a depth of almost four inches, which is about twice as deep as the one provided from the factory.

## Bill of Materials
The following table lists the materials needed to assemble the Cupholder

### M3 allen screw kit

You want a kit that has various lengths up to 25mm, that comes with nuts.

### Spring kit

0.6x7mm springs in 20mm, 25mm, and 30mm are recommended. This kit has more than enough.

### Misc
I recommend using loctite blue if you are using the nuts; otherwise you would need an M3 tap and tap holder as well.
