# Extras
This folder contains a set of misc files that would not be necessary for the general build but could be useful for a diy application, ie someone using this cupholder not in a Gallardo.

## Ring.stl
This is a loose model of the ring that comes with the factory car. For those that have a Gallardo and are retrofitting as I did, you do NOT need this part as you can simply reuse the one in the car.

However, for those building a custom application you will need this ring to hold the spring holder parts in order to have working fingers.

Note: you will want to use a cutting service like Send-Cut-Send to have this cut out of 1.7mm flat stock. The factory was some type of steel but aluminum would work. You should NOT 3D print this part as it will NOT be strong enough.

## GallardoCupHolder.step
This is the full design files that you can load into Fusion 360 or your 3D design program of choice to actually modify the designs.
