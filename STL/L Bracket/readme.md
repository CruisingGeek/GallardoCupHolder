# L Bracket
Print four of these parts.

I threaded these using an M3 tap so that the M3 screw going through didn't stick out to interfer with screwing down the cupholder. If you do not have a tap and don't want to do that, you could just use a nut on the back, but you might need to first loosly secure each L Bracket to the car panel, then lower the main cupholder down, and then screw it together.

I highly recommend printing on their side for better strength.
