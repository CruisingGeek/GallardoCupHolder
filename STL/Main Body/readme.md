# Main Body
Choose one of the two main bodies.

## CupHolder
This is the original version I printed in my car. Tested and simpler.

## CupHolder WideLip
This is a modified version I made but never pritned. Its main change is that I reduced the gap between the outer edge of the cupholder and hole in the leather panel.

This is untested as of yet, so use at your own warning.
