# Spring Holder
You need three spring holders. I used all three of the short version; however, this required using two 25mm springs and one 30mm spring. If you want to try and use all 25mm springs you could try the medium or long for the stick out bracket.

These will just friction fit on the factory metal ring part, but I provided some holes if you want to use a set screw or even drill the ring.
